SOLUTION FOR "undefined reference to inputChar" ERROR
=================================================

Your friend is getting this error because they're using the inputChar function
but the compiler can't find its implementation.

QUICK FIX:
---------
Tell your friend to compile with:

gcc i.c core/input.c -o i

This will include both their code (i.c) and the input library implementation (core/input.c).

PROPER INSTALLATION (RECOMMENDED):
----------------------------------
1. Give your friend the complete input_header folder
2. Have them run INSTALL.bat
3. Choose option 1 (Install for current user)
4. Then they can compile with:
   gcc -I"%USERPROFILE%\include" i.c -L"%USERPROFILE%\lib" -linput -o i

WHAT WAS HAPPENING:
------------------
- The #include <input.h> only gives function declarations
- The actual function code is in input.c or libinput.a
- Without linking to the implementation, you get "undefined reference" errors

ALTERNATIVE:
-----------
If they only have the .h file, they need either:
- The input.c file (use quick fix above)
- The libinput.a library file (install properly)
